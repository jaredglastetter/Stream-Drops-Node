Empowering Streamers, Engaging Fans: Simplifying NFTs with Walletless Onboarding and Flow Blockchain

# How it works

We have developed a new way for Twitch streamers to utilize their channel points in order to provide even more value to their loyal communities. Streamers can now create customized collectable art pieces, give away exclusive merchandise, or even dream up unique and personalized services that viewers can redeem using their accumulated channel points. Examples of such services could include shoutouts, coaching, or other personalized experiences.

By providing these personalized rewards, we believe that streamers can cultivate deeper relationships with their community and create a more engaging environment. We hope that our platform will encourage viewers to show their support and loyalty to the streamers who use our service, ultimately leading to a more successful and fulfilling streaming experience for everyone involved.

# Walletless Onboarding - Powered by Niftory
We have developed a distinctive method to welcome new users to our app and the Flow ecosystem. This approach involves leveraging Twitch's channel points reward system. When a user redeems a channel points reward on a Twitch channel, we can swiftly create a Flow wallet pre-loaded with the reward NFT on our app. This is all done before the user even arrives on our platform.

Therefore, when a user signs in to our app for the first time to view their reward, they are already onboarded with a Flow NFT in their wallet. This means they can immediately begin interacting with our app and the Flow ecosystem without any extra steps required. Our unique onboarding approach saves users time and provides a seamless experience.

# User Journey - App Custody (Hybrid Custody TBD)

To start, we are launching the app with in app custody. We will handle all web3 interactions behind the scenes to ensure that the user's first experience functions just like the other apps they user every day. Once the user is comfortable with upgrading to user custody, we will allow the user to export their rewards to their own wallet and be able to plug it in to our app.
